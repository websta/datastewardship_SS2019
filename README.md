# Analysis
The data has been analysed to find patterns in the Fremont Bridge usage by bicycles. Data is automatically collected via inductive loops on both pathways(east, west) leading over the bridge. Usage patterns (how many, maxima and minima, weekday usage, outlier analysis) are detected and described.
A Jupyter notebook is used for the analysis and will be the result of this task. The dataset is loaded with Python and is transformed and visualized to find usage patterns.

# Software used
Windows 10 with installed Anaconda3-2018.12-Windows-x86_64.
Used libraries and versions are:
``` 
python --version
pip list
conda list
systeminfo
```

# Dataset description
Taken from Website [data.seattle.gov](https://data.seattle.gov/Transportation/Fremont-Bridge-Hourly-Bicycle-Counts-by-Month-Octo/65db-xm6k).

Dataset name: Fremont Bridge Hourly Bicycle Counts by Month October 2012 to present

MD5 Hash of Fremont_Bridge_Hourly_Bicycle_Counts_by_Month_October_2012_to_present.csv: 28a7fe97c883090e44b0317ebe3d1807

The Fremont Bridge Bicycle Counter records the number of bikes that cross the bridge using the pedestrian/bicycle pathways. Inductive loops on the east and west pathways count the passing of bicycles regardless of travel direction. The data consists of a date/time field: Date, east pathway count field: Fremont Bridge NB, and west pathway count field: Fremont Bridge SB. The count fields represent the total bicycles detected during the specified one hour period. Direction of travel is not specified, but in general most traffic in the Fremont Bridge NB field is travelling northbound and most traffic in the Fremont Bridge SB field is travelling southbound.

# Dataset storage
The dataset will be retrieved only once for the task of the analysis. For secure storage it will be pushed Zendoo and retrieve a DOI. Even though the result will be published to Github and the repository will be pushed to Zendoo too.
